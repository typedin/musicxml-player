Contribution guidelines
======

Thank you for your interest in this work, and I am grateful that you feel it's worth your time and effort to consider contributing to it.

There are many different ways to contribute.

By using the module, you are already contributing! In fact, this is step 0 before any further steps: Please make sure you've read the (too sparse, I am sorry) documentation, and that you are able to form a mental model of how the "Theory of operation" relates to what you are seeing the module actually do.

Another way to contribute is by filing issues. If you're filing a bug, please make sure to clearly describe the reproduction scenario and your unmet expectations. The more details you supply, the better, including screenshots and screen video recordings. I appreciate bug reports a lot!

If you're submitting a feature request, please describe your use case first. I need to understand the big picture in your head to be able to decide whether I want to take on the effort and responsibility of building and maintaining this new code for the foreseeable future. We will have a spec discussion where I can better understand the details of what you're looking for.

Same if you're considering to work on a PR. I strongly suggest you open a feature request issue first, where you describe what you are planning to build. By having both a spec discussion and an implementation strategy discussion, we can make sure that you're building something that will integrate smoothly in my current and future vision for this module. I would probably be able to offer some guidance on a good implementation approach.

**Regarding vibe coding**: AI-generated text and code is easily detectable (for the time being at least) because it is needlessly verbose and lacks focus. If you use GenAI, please make sure to spend time a) better prompting the AI, and b) refactoring the generated output to make it easier for me, your audience, to read it and comprehend it. Otherwise, I might sadly have to reject your contribution.

Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to collaborate with you!
